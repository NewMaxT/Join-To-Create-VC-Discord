### Quiz Automation (Google Sheets)

Automate granting an access role to users who pass a quiz tracked in Google Sheets.

Requirements:
- A Google Service Account with access to your spreadsheet (Editor for status logging)
- Environment variables set in `.env`:
  - `DISCORD_TOKEN=xxxxx`
  - Option A: `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON={"type":"service_account",...}`
  - Option B: `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE=C:\\path\\to\\service_account.json`

Commands:
- `/quiz setup` – configure the integration
  - `spreadsheet_id`: The Google Sheet ID
  - `waiting_role`: Discord role users must already have to be eligible (required)
  - `access_role`: Discord role to grant when passed (required)
  - `min_score`: Minimum score to pass (default 17)
  - `log_channel`: Optional channel to log actions
- `/quiz status` – view current configuration and runtime status
- `/quiz test` – test connectivity and show sample results

What it does:
- Polls Google Sheets for new quiz results (Column B: score, Column C: Discord username). Interval is 60s by default (configurable via `/quiz setup`), and auto-reduces to 5s when more than 5 new lines need processing.
- If user exists on the server, has the waiting role, and score >= min_score → grants access role
- Writes a status row on the same spreadsheet in the `Statut - Roles` tab with timestamp, guild, user, score, result (✅/❌), details (FR). The tab is auto-formatted as a dynamic table (frozen header, filter, auto-width, bold header, named range `Statut_Roles`).

Google API rate limit:
- Hard limit: 1 request/second. The bot enforces this with a throttle.
- You can override the minimal interval via `.env`:
  ```
  GOOGLE_API_MIN_INTERVAL=1.0
  ```
  Keep it at 1.0 or higher. Do not set below 1.0.

How to get the Service Account JSON:
- Go to Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Enable “Google Sheets API”
- Create Credentials → Service account → finish
- Open the service account → Keys → Add key → Create new key → JSON → Download
- Copy the service account email (ends with `@<project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
- Share your Google Sheet with that email as Editor (needed for the `Statut - Roles` tab)

### Mass role assignment

Assign a role to many members at once:
- `/massgive target_role:@Role everyone:true` – give the role to everyone on the server
- `/massgive target_role:@Role filter_role:@AnotherRole` – give the role only to members who have AnotherRole

Notes:
- Bot must have Manage Roles and its highest role must be above the target role.

Configure the bot with the JSON (choose one):
- Option A (.env inline JSON):
  ```
  DISCORD_TOKEN=xxxxx
  GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON={"type":"service_account","project_id":"...","private_key_id":"...","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n","client_email":"...@...iam.gserviceaccount.com","client_id":"...","auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth","token_uri":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs","client_x509_cert_url":"..."}
  ```
- Option B (file path in .env):
  ```
  DISCORD_TOKEN=xxxxx
  GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE=C:\\path\\to\\service_account.json
  ```
